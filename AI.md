This document details any instance where I consulted AI while working on this project. The AI tool I chose to use is [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/chat).

**Some responses are shortened** to just the part that I used, as Bard tends to provide long responses that stray away from the topic at hand.

> **Me:**
> How can I use a Dockerfile to run a script each time the container starts?

> **Bard:** To run a script each time the container starts using a Dockerfile, you can use the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction. 
> The `ENTRYPOINT` instruction specifies the command that will be executed when the container starts. 
> This command can be either a shell command or a path to an executable file.
>
> To run a script using the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, simply add the following line to your Dockerfile:
> ```dockerfile
> ENTRYPOINT ["/path/to/script.sh"]
> ```
>
> This will cause the script to be executed each time the container is started.
>
> For example, the following Dockerfile would run the script `initialize.sh` each time the container is started:
> ```dockerfile
> FROM nginx:latest
>
> ENTRYPOINT ["/initialize.sh"]
>
> COPY initialize.sh /
> ```

> **Me:**
> How do I run an SQL file to initialize my database in a MySQL Docker container? I want to do this using a Dockerfile.

> **Bard:**
> To run an SQL file to initialize your database in a MySQL Docker container using a Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Create a Dockerfile for your MySQL container.
> 2. In the Dockerfile, copy your SQL file to the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory.
This is the directory where MySQL will look for initialization scripts when the container starts up.
> 3. Build your Docker image.
> 4. Run your Docker container.
> 
> For example, the following Dockerfile will create a MySQL container that initializes the database using the SQL file `example.sql`:
> ```dockerfile
> FROM mysql:latest
> 
> COPY example.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
> ```

> **Me:**
> How can I make query a MySQL database from within a PHP application?

> **Bard:**
> To query a MySQL database from within a PHP application, you can use the following steps:
>
> 1. Connect to the MySQL database using the `mysqli_connect()` function.
> 2. Prepare the SQL query using the `mysqli_prepare()` function.
> 3. Bind the parameters to the prepared statement using the `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()` function.
> 4. Execute the prepared statement using the `mysqli_stmt_execute()` function.
> 5. Get the results from the executed statement using the `mysqli_stmt_get_result()` function.
> 6. Loop through the results and display them.
> 
> The following PHP code shows a simple example of how to query a MySQL database:
> ```php
> <?php
>
> // Connect to the MySQL database.
> $conn = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'password', 'my_database');
>
> // Prepare the SQL query.
> $sql = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?';
> $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);
>
> // Bind the parameters to the prepared statement.
> mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 's', '%john%');
>
> // Execute the prepared statement.
> mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
>
> // Get the results from the executed statement.
> $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);
>
> // Loop through the results and display them.
> while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
>     echo $row['name'] . '<br>';
> }
>
> // Close the connection to the MySQL database.
> mysqli_close($conn);
>
> ?>
> ```
>
> This code will select all rows from the `users` table where the `name` column contains the string `john`. 
> The results will then be displayed on the web page.
>
> You can use this basic approach to query a MySQL database from within a PHP application for any purpose, 
> such as displaying data on a web page, saving data to the database, or updating data in the database.

> **Bard:**
> Your PHP code is well-written and efficient. However, there are a few minor things that could be improved:
> - You could use a `try/catch` block to handle any database errors that may occur. For example:
> ```php
> try {
>     $conn = mysqli_connect("sql:3306", "root", "password", "apache");
>
>     $sql = 'SELECT name FROM names limit 1';
>     $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);
>
>     mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
>
>     $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);
>     $name = $result->fetch_row()[0];
>
>     echo "<h1>$name has reached Milestone 1!!!</h1>";
> } catch (Exception $e) {
>     echo "<h1>Error: {$e->getMessage()}</h1>";
> }
> ```
> 
> - You could use a function to encapsulate the database logic. This would make your code more reusable and easier to maintain. 
> For example:
> ```php
> function get_name($conn, $sql) {
>     $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);
>     mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
>     $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);
>     $name = $result->fetch_column();
>     return $name;
> }
> 
> $name = get_name($conn, 'SELECT name FROM names limit 1');
> echo "<h1>$name has reached Milestone 1!!!</h1>";
> ```
> 
> Overall, your code is well-written and efficient. 
> The minor improvements I suggested are just a matter of personal preference and style.
